# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Deployment to Render

This project is configured for easy deployment to [Render](https://render.com/).

### Automatic Deployment with render.yaml

1. Create a new account or log in to your existing account on [Render](https://render.com/).
2. Connect your GitHub repository to Render.
3. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file and configure your deployment.
4. Click "Create New" and select "Blueprint" to deploy using the render.yaml configuration.

### Manual Deployment

Alternatively, you can manually deploy the application:

1. Create a new Static Site on Render.
2. Connect your GitHub repository.
3. Configure the following settings:
   - Build Command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Publish Directory: `build`
4. Add the following environment variable:
   - `NODE_VERSION`: `18.x`
5. Under "Advanced" settings, add a redirect rule:
   - Source: `/*`
   - Destination: `/index.html`
   - Status: `200`

### Post-Deployment

After deployment, your application will be available at the URL provided by Render. You can configure a custom domain in the Render dashboard if needed.
